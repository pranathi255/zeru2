Compound Wallet Risk Scoring

This project assigns a risk score (0â€“1000) to 100 Ethereum wallet addresses based on their historical activity on the Compound V2 and V3 protocols. It uses on-chain data to evaluate how safely or aggressively each wallet interacts with lending and borrowing.

 How It Works

1. Input: A list of 100 wallet addresses in wallets.csv.
2. Data Fetching: For each wallet, the script fetches Compound protocol activity using the [GoldRush API](https://goldrush.dev/platform).
3. Feature Extraction: Metrics like `total_supplied`, `total_borrowed`, and `borrow/supply ratio` are calculated.
4. Scoring: A score between 0 and 1000 is computed for each wallet based on risk factors.
5. Output: The scores are saved in `scores.csv`.

Score Interpretation
Score Range	Risk Level	Meaning
900â€“1000ðŸŸ¢ Very Low Risk	Only supplies to Compound
800â€“900	ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk	Supplies actively, does not borrow
700â€“800	ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk	Moderate borrowing, well-collateralized
500â€“700	ðŸŸ  High Risk	Borrowing close to supplied amount
200â€“500	ðŸ”´ Very High Risk	Aggressively borrowing relative to supply
0â€“200	âš« Unknown/Empty	No meaningful Compound activity found
